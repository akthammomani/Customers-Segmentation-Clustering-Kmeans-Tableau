## 1. Introduction

This project is based on a book called [Data Smart](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Smart-Science-Transform-Information/dp/111866146X), written by John Foreman, head of product for MailChimp. This book is an excellent business analytics primer that walks you through a variety of machine learning use cases, complete with sample data sets and detailed instructions on how to set up and solve each case in Excel. 

One of these cases, John describes a fictitious wholesale wine business looking to optimize sales by segmenting customers â€” restaurant and liquor store owners, into groups based on buying behavior. This is a very common problem faced by all kinds of businesses from large retailers like Walmart and Target to your friendly neighborhood liquor store.
